### Project Title
BikeShare Data Comparison

### Description
*Thanks to the rise in information technologies*, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, we will use data provided by **Motivate**, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

### Files used
Python Files:
* bikeshare.py

Data Sets:
* chicago.csv
